### Deitos Node Start

For detailed instructions on setting up and running the Deitos node, please refer to the [README.md](../README.md) file. 

## 1 - Infrastructure Provider Registration

### 1.1 - Register as an Infrastructure Provider

To register as an Infrastructure Provider (IP), execute the `ipRegister` extrinsic. This step involves registering BOB as an IP with a provision of 100 GB storage (expressed in MB as 10000). 

![userdoc.ip.register](assets/userdoc.ip.register.png)


The successful registration is confirmed by the `IPRegistered` event.

![userdoc.ip.event](assets/userdoc.ip.event.png)

A minimum balance of 10,000 DEITOs is required in the account for registration. This amount gets reserved from BOB's account upon submission of the `ipRegister` extrinsic, as shown in the account balance.

![userdoc.ip.balance](assets/userdoc.ip.balance.png)

### 1.2 - Manually Activate the IP

Initially, the IP status is `Pending`, indicating ongoing checks by the Deitos Protocol. To activate the IP manually, use the `updateIPStatus` extrinsic. This requires administrative access, typically available to the Root account (ALICE in local settings).

![userdoc.ip.storage](assets/userdoc.ip.storage.png)

The 'Pending' status signifies that the Deitos Protocol is in the process of thoroughly inspecting the Infrastructure Provider's technical stack. This phase involves a suite of checks and tests, meticulously conducted to confirm that all necessary services for the IP are functional and up to standard. As this validation process is still in its developmental stages, the interim solution involves using the `updateIPStatus` call. This permissioned action allows for the manual activation of the IP, facilitating the continuation of testing activities.

![IP Activation](assets/userdoc.ip.activation.png)

This step necessitates the use of the Sudo tab due to local settings where the Root key is configured with the ALICE account. Following these procedures, we will have a fully operational Infrastructure Provider, primed and ready to engage in agreements.

## 2 - Agreement's Submission (Happy Path)

### 2.1- Execute Agreement Request (Consumer)

Initiating the agreement negotiation process begins with the consumer submitting a request to the selected Infrastructure Provider (IP) using the `consumerRequestAgreement` extrinsic:

![userdoc.consumer.agreement.request](assets/userdoc.consumer.agreement.request.png)

Each parameter of the agreement request is detailed as follows:

- **IP:** The account of the chosen Infrastructure Provider.
- **Storage:** The total amount of storage allocated for use during the agreement.
- **Activation Block:** Given the negotiable nature of agreements, the activation block is set in the future.
- **Payment Plan:** This outlines the duration of each period within the agreement, specifying the start and end of each period expressed in block numbers.

The accompanying image outlines the agreement's periods as follows:

| Period | Start | End  | Duration | Installment             |
| ------ | ----- | ---- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| 1      | 50    | 80   | 30       | 30,000,000 (3 DEITOs)   |
| 2      | 80    | 110  | 30       | 30,000,000 (3 DEITOs)   |
| 3      | 110   | 140  | 30       | 30,000,000 (3 DEITOs)   |
| 4      | 140   | 160  | 20       | 20,000,000 (2 DEITOs)   |
 
Post-execution, the subsequent event confirms the request:

![userdoc.consumer.agreement.event](assets/userdoc.consumer.agreement.event.png)

To ensure the consumer's commitment to the agreement, the last installment (installment #4 in this scenario) is reserved from the consumer's account as a "service deposit". Additionally, a smaller "security deposit" is held, which is reimbursed upon the consumer's feedback submission following the agreement's conclusion. This security deposit is a fixed amount of 1,000,000 units (0.1 DEITO).

An inspection of the account will display the reserved balance as follows:

![userdoc.consumer.agreement.balance](assets/userdoc.consumer.agreement.balance.png)

### 2.2 - IP Agreement Request Acceptance

After the consumer submits their request, the Infrastructure Provider (IP) must decide to either accept or deny it. The IP also has the option to propose a new payment plan that better suits its needs. We will explore this in more detail later.

For now, the process of accepting an agreement using the `IpAcceptAgreement` extrinsic is straightforward:

![userdoc.ip.accept.agreement](assets/userdoc.ip.accept.agreement.png)

Execution of this extrinsic leads to a change in status, as depicted in the following events:

![userdoc.ip.accept.agreement.event](assets/userdoc.ip.accept.agreement.event.png)

### 2.3 - Consumer Installment Prepayment

With the agreement set to commence at block 50, the consumer is required to prepay the first installment. This step ensures that the first period of the agreement is financially secured:

![userdoc.consumer.agreement.prepay](assets/userdoc.consumer.agreement.prepay.png)

This prepayment action reserves the corresponding amount in the consumerâ€™s account, meaning the funds are not immediately accessible to the IP. The installment becomes available for withdrawal by the IP after the period ends, as per our example, after block 80.

Upon reviewing CHARLIE's account, the reserved balance now includes the amount for the first installment:

![userdoc.consumer.agreement.balance.after](assets/userdoc.consumer.agreement.balance.after.png)

### 2.4 - Inspecting Agreement Storage Item

Inspecting the agreement storage item reveals comprehensive details about all actions related to the agreement:

![userdoc.ip.accept.agreement.storage](assets/userdoc.ip.accept.agreement.storage.png)

It also includes the payment history, showing that the first prepayment has been made and will become available to the IP after the end of the period.

### 2.5 - Completing All Installment Prepayments

To simplify this demonstration, we'll complete all prepayments, ensuring the consumer stays current with payments. This involves repeating the steps from 2.3 as necessary until all installments are paid.

Upon examining CHARLIE's account post-prepayment, the updated reserved balance is visible:

![userdoc.consumer.agreement.balance.allpaid](assets/userdoc.consumer.agreement.balance.allpaid.png)

### 2.6 - IP Withdrawal and Agreement Completion

Upon the conclusion of the agreement, the Infrastructure Provider (IP) is eligible to withdraw all corresponding installments for the service. The IP can withdraw the entire amount at once by executing the `IpWithdrawInstallments` extrinsic:

![userdoc.ip.withdraw](assets/userdoc.ip.withdraw.png)

The subsequent events detail the withdrawal process. With the agreement completed and no further payments due, the system automatically updates the agremeent's status to `Completed`:

![userdoc.ip.withdraw.event](assets/userdoc.ip.withdraw.event.png)

### 2.7 - IP Feedback Submission for On-Chain Reputation

With the agreement finalized, the last step in the process is the submission of feedback about the IP in relation to the agreement:

![userdoc.consumer.feedback](assets/userdoc.consumer.feedback.png)

The event showcases the submitted feedback:

![userdoc.consumer.feedback.event](assets/userdoc.consumer.feedback.event.png)

It's important to note that while the consumer can include comments in the feedback, which are displayed in the events, this text is not stored in any storage item. This reduce the need for unnecesary storage costs and still, having the text accessible by inspecting the events.

Following the feedback submission, the service deposit is released:

![userdoc.consumer.feedback.storage](assets/userdoc.consumer.feedback.storage.png)

### 2.8 - Agreement Cleanup

Anticipating a high volume of agreements, storage optimization measures have been implemented, which involve deleting storage items associated with finished agreements. To access historical agreement data, archive nodes and off-chain indexing services, akin to those used by block explorers, can be utilized.

## 3 Agreement Renegotiation

The deitos pallet is fundamentally designed to offer flexibility, enabling Infrastructure Providers (IPs) and consumers to negotiate mutually beneficial agreements. This flexibility allows for the modification of payment plans if the initial proposal does not meet the needs of both parties.

### 3.1 - Execute Agreement Request (Consumer)

In this scenario, we'll execute an agreement where the consumer sets a notably small security deposit, reflecting the comparatively lower amount of the final installment:

![userdoc.consumer.agreement.unbalance](assets/userdoc.consumer.agreement.unbalance.png)

### 3.2 - New Payment Plan Proposal

Suppose the IP prefers a more consistent payment plan with shorter intervals. In such a case, the IP has the option to propose a revised payment plan:

![userdoc.ip.new.payment.plan](assets/userdoc.ip.new.payment.plan.png)

The submission of this new payment plan is confirmed by the following event:

![userdoc.ip.new.payment.event.plan](assets/userdoc.ip.new.payment.plan.event.png)

### 3.3 - Consumer Rejects the New Payment Plan

If the consumer decides not to accept the new payment plan proposed by the Infrastructure Provider (IP), they have the option to revoke the agreement:

![userdoc.consumer.agreement.revoke](assets/userdoc.consumer.agreement.revoke.png)

The corresponding event confirms the revocation of the agreement. It also indicates that the deposit amount initially reserved for the agreement has been released and returned to the consumer:

![userdoc.consumer.agreement.revoke.event](assets/userdoc.consumer.agreement.revoke.event.png)

## 4 Agreements Cancelled Due to Unpaid Installment

This section demonstrates how an agreement is terminated if the consumer fails to continue payments. Non-payment leads to termination of the agreement and forfeiture of the consumer's deposits.

### 4.1 - Execute Agreement Request (Consumer)

As part of the process, the consumer requests an agreement, which is subsequently accepted by the Infrastructure Provider (IP):

![userdoc.consumer.request.tofail](assets/userdoc.consumer.request.tofail.png)

### 4.2 - Accept Agreement and Make First Installment

Once the IP accepts the agreement and it becomes active, the consumer proceeds to pay the first installment. This step is crucial for the agreement to commence as planned.


![userdoc.consumer.firstinstallment.tofail](assets/userdoc.consumer.firstinstallment.tofail.png)

Following the payment of the first installment, a specific balance is reserved from the consumer's account. This reserved amount includes the Service Deposit, the First Installment, and the Security Deposit (equivalent to the Last Installment).

![userdoc.consumer.balance.tofail](assets/userdoc.consumer.balance.tofail.png)

### 4.3 - Terminate the Agreement Due to Non-Payment

In this phase, the process involves deliberately not completing the consumer's payment, thereby placing the consumer at fault. When the IP observes that the payment has not been made within the designated timeframe, it has the authority to terminate the agreement and enact penalties against the consumer:

![userdoc.ip.terminate](assets/userdoc.ip.terminate.png)

As a result of this termination due to non-payment, the consumer faces penalties. All reserved funds associated with this agreement are transferred to the IP, and the agreement is conclusively terminated.

Following the termination and completion of all required actions, the agreement's related storage items are cleared from the system. This step ensures efficient management of system resources and data integrity.

## 5 Upload Files and Data Integrity Protocol

Having explored every agreement management option, we now turn our attention to the file upload and data integrity protocol. This protocol allows the Deitos system to assess whether a consumer is authorized to upload files to the infrastructure provider.

In this demonstration, we focus on the upload functionality of the protocol, re-engaging with the same infrastructure provider, BOB, but introducing a different consumer: ALICE.

We establish a simple agreement between ALICE (consumer) and BOB (IP), consisting of just two lengthy installments of 3000 blocks each. This setup allows us to concentrate on the nuances of file upload and verification:

## 5.1 Set Agreement

![userdoc.5.request.agreement](assets/userdoc.5.request.agreement.png)

Upon confirmation, the system retrieves the agreement ID, essential for subsequent steps:

![userdoc.5.request.agreement.event](assets/userdoc.5.request.agreement.event.png)

Note: In this example, we use agreement ID "1". Users following this documentation sequentially may encounter higher ID numbers.

As in previous steps, the IP must approve the agreement:

![userdoc.5.ip.accept.agreement](assets/userdoc.5.ip.accept.agreement.png)

To prepare for file uploads, the consumer must complete an installment:

![userdoc.5.consumer.prepayinstalment](assets/userdoc.5.consumer.prepayinstalment.png)

With these preparations complete, ALICE is now ready to upload files under her agreement.

## 5.2 Uploading Files

The Deitos development team has created a CLI tool enabling users to upload files to the IP, contingent on the status of their agreements.

Users can download the CLI tool from the following link:

https://github.com/Deitos-Network/deitos-cli/releases/download/v0.0.1/deitos-cli

After downloading the binary, users can initiate the upload process.

First, create a test file:

```
 echo "this is my new super great file" > grant.txt
```

Next, execute the CLI command to upload the file:

```
deitos-cli upload  --file-path=./examples/grant.txt --deitos-url=ws://localhost:9944 --ip-url=http://localhost:9090 --agreement=1 --suri=//Alice

```

The successful upload is confirmed as follows:

```
File hash: 4e9f6244c3edacc38d29792b9815803c64e4040106fad90771838f950968f072

Uploading file to http://localhost:9090/v1/files with JWT eyJhbGciOiJTcjI1NTE5IiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzdWIiOiI1R3J3dmFFRjV6WGIyNkZ6OXJjUXBEV1M1N0N0RVJIcE5laFhDUGNOb0hHS3V0UVkiLCJhdWQiOjEsImV4cCI6MTcxMDM1NDAxMjAwMSwiaWF0IjoxNzEwMjY3NjEyMDAxfQ.UhZb15pqZxk5zws1-8DyHcDLFgMMv4maKtHRIVz45GpcO1pvbpOGIB7v3GEycHZWo_UwT4nrA8K1jYrcREYAiw
File uploaded successfully
```

This process triggers a confirmation event:

![userdoc.5.file.registered](assets/userdoc.5.file.registered.png)

The CLI's functionality is noteworthy, involving several steps:

1) Encrypting the file with SHA256.
2) Wrapping the consumer's signature, in this case, ALICE's, within a JWT token.
3) The Proxy (a.k.a. Deitos Gate) verifies the incoming request against the active agreement with the provider (BOB in this case).
4) Upon meeting all conditions, the proxy signs the message and invokes the `deitosFS:registerFile` extrinsic.

To test the CLI's functionality further, we attempt to upload a file from an unauthorized consumer:

First, create another test file:


```
echo "This file will never be uploaded" >  examples/file_to_fail.txt
```

Attempting to upload the file with a different account, such as CHARLIE's, results in the Deitos Gate rejecting the request:

```
deitos-cli upload  --file-path=./examples/file_to_fail.txt --deitos-url=ws://localhost:9944 --ip-url=http://localhost:9090 --agreement=1 --suri=//Charlie
File hash: c0b4f8ec665aef7d05e5838b87010b1fdf8f3995ce21f312380d6e2c6ceb5c8a
File registration submitted, waiting for transaction to be finalized...
thread 'main' panicked at src/chain.rs:68:14:
File registration should finalize: Runtime(Module(ModuleError(<Deitos::NoAgreementForConsumer>)))
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```


## 5.3 File Upload Verification

Following a successful upload, the IP initiates a verification process:

1) It queries the recently uploaded file.
2) An off-chain worker, through the [Deitos Verifier](https://github.com/Deitos-Network/deitos-verifier), retrieves the file content, calculates its SHA256 hash, and verifies it against the hash calculated by the CLI.

Verification success triggers the corresponding event:

![userdoc.5.file.verified](assets/userdoc.5.file.verified.png)

The file's successful upload can also be confirmed via the Hadoop file explorer:

![userdoc.5.fileuploaded.hadoop](assets/userdoc.5.fileuploaded.hadoop.png)
http://localhost:50070/explorer.html#/data/deitos

Accessing the file verifies that the content matches:

![userdoc.5.fileuploaded.hadoop.content](assets/userdoc.5.fileuploaded.hadoop.content.png)

## 5.4 Data Integrity Protocol

The Deitos Network ensures the integrity of uploaded files. Utilizing the [Deitos Verifier](https://github.com/Deitos-Network/deitos-verifier), an off-chain worker periodically selects a verified file at random. It then confirms that the blockchain-registered hash matches the verifier-retrieved file's hash.

In this exercise, with only one file uploaded, the data integrity protocol confirms a successful check for file ID 1:

![userdoc.5.file.check.verified](assets/userdoc.5.file.check.verified.png)
